Your accounts have already been installed in machines of room 101. Each can be regarded as a computation node of a ten-node parallel machine.

Here is the related information:

  node name: l040101-ws01.ua.pt up to l040101-ws10.ua.pt

  login: sd#??   , where # stands for lab class (1 to 4) and ?? for group number (01 to 10)

  password: qwerty ( you may change it)  .

Presently, nodes l040101-ws04.ua.pt and l040101-ws10.ua.pt are not operacional (so they can not be used yet). All the others are available.

You can connect to any operacional node from any point in the campus by using directly the command

                   ssh sd#??@l040101-ws&&.ua.pt
				   
				   -> ssh sd306@l040101-ws01.ua.pt

or from anywhere outside by the same command, but now through a vpn coonection.

Please remember you must install the commands "sshpass" and xterm in your laptops to deploy and remotely run in the nodes of the parallel machine any application you may design.

Remember also you should connect manually, at least once, to every node of the parallel machine before running any shell script of deployment.

Port numbers assigned to each group when running the code of assignment 2 in the computer network of lab class 101:

	10 specific port numbers are assigned to each group according to the formula that lists the first (the other nine follow in order)

					  first port number for group y of lab class x = 22000 + 100 * x + 10 * (y - 1)   .
					  
												y (group) = 6
												x (lab)   = 3
												
												-> 22000 + 100 * 3 + 10 * (6 - 1)
												-> 22000 + 300 + 50
												-> 22350 (first port)

	Thus, for example, group 5 of lab class 2 has got the port numbers 22240 up to 22249.
